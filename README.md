Creating a calculator app that utilizes principles of functional programming as much as possible, including:
-  immutability (mostly)
-  recursion
-  currying
-  pure functions

To do:
- implement logic for period button
- use result of calculation as initial value for next calculation
- more currying
- refactoring
